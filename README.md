Newton Raphson Consensus (with Push-sum Consensus)

This algorithm can be started by executing the "Simulation.py". At the very beginning of the execution, the number of "node" should be inserted as an input parameter, but the rest of the parameters will be fetched from "SimulationSpecification.py"

To modify other input parameters either they can be directly modified inside the "SimulationSpecification.py" or by uncommenting the commented code in that class, all parameters can be passed at the beginning of execution in the console.
